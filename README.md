ComicCleaner
============
Scanning your own comic collection for safekeeping is fun. Corrupted or incomplete archives are not! 
comicCleaner analyzes you comic library and finds all the broken and incomplete {cbr,cbz} files.

## What can it do?

* Find corrupted files in your library
* Find comics that have too few pages, which indicates a valid but incomplete scan.

###Disclaimer : 
ComicCleaner is for use with comics you scanned yourself or acquired by legal means. I do not condone piracy in any way.
